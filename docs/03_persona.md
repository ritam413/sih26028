### Persona 1: Divisional Section Controller (Sr. DOM / Section Dispatcher)
* **Title:** Senior Divisional Operations Manager (Sr. DOM) / Section Controller
* **Operational Setting:** Divisional Railway Control Office (Operating Directorate)
* **Core Responsibilities:**
  * Supervises real-time corridor throughput across 100+ route kilometers.
  * Resolves train precedence (Rajdhani/Vande Bharat > Express > Freight).
  * Evaluates and sanctions track possessions (Traffic & Power Blocks) via COA and e-BDMS.
* **Pain Points with Legacy System:**
  * Overwhelmed by fragmented, uncoordinated block memos from three separate departments.
  * Fear of causing train punctuality losses leads to rejecting critical maintenance blocks.
  * Lacks visual decision-support tools to identify natural traffic gaps in train charts.
* **Key IRIS AI Features Used:**
  * **Corridor Time-Distance String Chart (`CorridorStringChart.tsx`):** Real-time visual comparison of train paths vs bundled block windows.
  * **One-Click Sanction Gate:** Approves AI-optimized joint shadow blocks with automatic safety dispatch.
  * **Advisory vs. Autonomous Mode Toggle:** Switches between human-in-the-loop sanctioning and automated rule-based approval.

### Persona 2: Departmental Maintenance Planners (P-Way, TRD, S&T SSEs)
* **Titles:** 
  * Senior Section Engineer (P-Way / Civil) — TMS
  * Senior Section Engineer (TRD / Electrical) — TDMS
  * Senior Section Engineer (Signal / S&T) — SMMS
* **Operational Setting:** Divisional Engineering Maintenance Depots
* **Core Responsibilities:**
  * Enters track flaw tickets (USFD IMR/OBS/REM), 25kV OHE catenary wear logs, and point machine overhauls.
  * Schedules heavy machinery (Continuous Action Tampers - CSM, Ballast Cleaners - BCM, Tower Wagons) and manpower gangs.
* **Pain Points with Legacy System:**
  * Sits through contentious divisional daily block meetings where requisitions are routinely curtailed or rejected.
  * Civil gangs and Tower Wagons sit idle waiting for separate block possessions on the same track.
* **Key IRIS AI Features Used:**
  * **Department Demand Queue (`IncidentQueue.tsx`):** Tracks demand status (`PENDING_TRIAGE`, `SLOTTED`, `SANCTIONED`).
  * **Shadow-Block Bundling View:** Reviews co-location proposals where Civil and S&T share an electrical power cut window.
  * **Machine Transit Coordinator:** Verifies track machine transit times and siding reachability.

---

### Persona 3: Safety Compliance Auditor / RDSO Inspector
* **Title:** Commissioner of Railway Safety (CRS) Inspector / RDSO Safety Auditor
* **Operational Setting:** Zonal Headquarters / RDSO Directorate
* **Core Responsibilities:**
  * Audits block execution logs, safety clearance headways ($\ge 15\text{ min}$), and interlocking lockouts.
  * Investigates safety anomalies, signal passing at danger (SPAD), and track maintenance compliance.
* **Pain Points with Legacy System:**
  * Paper-based registers and fragmented logs make post-incident root cause analysis tedious and error-prone.
  * Inability to verify whether drivers complied with Temporary Speed Restrictions (TSRs).
* **Key IRIS AI Features Used:**
  * **Explainable AI Decision Dossier (`DecisionLogModal.tsx`):** 4-step chronological audit trail (Ingestion $\to$ Conflict Check $\to$ Shadow Bundling $\to$ Safety Sanction).
  * **SHA-256 Digital Verification:** Verifies cryptographic integrity of sanction logs.
  * **RDSO Form 14B Certificate Generator:** One-click PDF/JSON export of certified compliance documents.

---

### Persona 4: Locomotive Pilot & Station Master (Field Operations)
* **Titles:** Loco Pilot (Driver) / Station Master (SM)
* **Operational Setting:** Locomotive Cab / Station Interlocking Control Room
* **Core Responsibilities:**
  * Safely navigates trains through active maintenance zones according to signaling aspects and caution orders.
  * Station Master ensures physical track possession and clamps signals/turnouts per *G&SR Chapter 15*.
* **Pain Points with Legacy System:**
  * Relying on physical paper Caution Orders (**Form T/409**) handed over at preceding stations.
  * Risk of unexpected signal drops in driver face causing false SPAD or emergency braking.
* **Key IRIS AI Features Used:**
  * **Kavach TCAS Wireless TSR Stream:** Receives digital $30\text{ km/h}$ speed caps directly into the locomotive cab onboard unit.
  * **Station Interlocking State View (`InterlockingMap.tsx`):** Verifies electronic interlocking lockout (**Form S&T/T-351**) and signal danger clamps (`S-12/14`).

## 🛡️ 3. Authentication & Authorization Security Invariants

1. **Dual-Factor Sanction Authorization:** Critical block sanctions on trunk routes require cryptographic token validation tied to the active Section Controller session.
2. **Statutory Verbal Fallback Logging (G&SR 15.06):** In case of field mobile supervisor disconnection, the Station Master inputs a verified **Private Number (PN)** into the console, which is immutably stamped with an `OFFLINE_STATUTORY_FALLBACK` audit flag.
3. **Fail-Safe Principle:** If user session or network link terminates unexpectedly, all active interlocking clamps and Kavach Temporary Speed Restrictions remain rigidly enforced at their most restrictive safety state until formally unlocked.
