## II. Description & The Operational Problem

### 1. The Real-World Railway Context
Indian Railways is the fourth-largest rail network in the world, operating more than 13,000 passenger trains and 8,000 freight rakes every day across 68,000 route kilometers. To keep trains running safely at speeds up to 130–160 km/h, tracks, electrical wires, and signals must be inspected and repaired continuously.

Three independent engineering directorates maintain these assets:
1. **Civil Engineering (Permanent Way / P-Way):** Maintains physical rails, concrete sleepers, crushed-stone ballast beds, points, crossings, and bridges. Uses heavy on-track machinery such as Continuous Action Tampers (CSM, Duomatic), Dynamic Track Stabilizers (DTS), and Ballast Cleaning Machines (BCM). Track flaws are logged in the **Track Management System (TMS)** per *IRPWM 2020*.
2. **Electrical / Traction Distribution (TRD):** Maintains 25,000-volt AC Overhead Equipment (OHE), catenary and contact wires, traction substations, and neutral sections. Line crews use motorized Tower Wagons to inspect contact wire wear and wash insulators. Maintenance records are tracked in the **Traction Distribution Management System (TDMS)** per *ACTM Vol II*.
3. **Signal & Telecommunication (S&T):** Maintains electronic interlocking (EI) systems, motorized point machines, track circuits (DC and Audio Frequency), axle counters, and trackside Kavach RFID balises. Defect logs and statutory disconnection notices are processed in the **Signalling Maintenance & Management System (SMMS)** per *IRSEM 2021*.
4. **Traffic / Operating Directorate:** Section Controllers and Station Masters manage train dispatching, timetables, and train precedence (Rajdhani and Vande Bharat > Mail/Express > Freight) via the **Control Office Application (COA)**.

### 2. The Core Bottleneck: Siloed Requisitions & Corridor Fragmentation
To perform maintenance safely on a track, engineers must secure a **"Block"** (a temporary suspension of train traffic or a 25kV electrical power shutdown). In the existing operational workflow, each department submits standalone requests through legacy portals (e-BDMS) or paper memos without cross-departmental coordination:

* **Monday:** Civil Engineering secures a 3-hour block on Track Section A-B for track tamping.
* **Wednesday:** Electrical TRD secures a 2.5-hour power cutoff on the *exact same section* to replace worn contact wire.
* **Friday:** S&T secures a 2-hour block on the *exact same section* to overhaul point machines.

**The Failure Mode:** The railway corridor is shut down **three separate times in a single week**, causing 7.5 hours of accumulated traffic disruption. Section Controllers in the Divisional Control Office, under immense pressure to prevent train delays, frequently reject or truncate maintenance requests. This leads to **deferred maintenance**, increased risks of rail fractures or OHE breakdowns, and emergency **Temporary Speed Restrictions (TSRs)** that permanently slow down train operations.

```

### 3. The Solution: Automated Joint Shadow Blocking
IRIS AI (Intelligent Railway Inspection and Restoration AI) introduces an automated mathematical solver that eliminates siloed planning. When an electrical power cutoff is approved for Section A-B, the solver checks TMS and SMMS for pending work on the same spatial track section. It automatically bundles all three maintenance tasks into a single **3.5-hour Joint Shadow Block** during natural nocturnal traffic lulls (01:30 AM to 05:00 AM).

Civil track gangs and S&T technicians work safely underneath the de-energized electrical catenary wire simultaneously. The result is a **35% to 50% reduction in corridor downtime**, zero passenger train cancellations, and complete regulatory compliance.

```

### 1. Multi-System Ingestion & Spatial Chainage Adapter
* **The Problem:** Legacy railway databases record maintenance locations using physical kilometer posts (e.g., `KM 108/4 to 112/2`). Electrical OHE records reference catenary mast numbers (e.g., `Mast 108/12`), and S&T systems reference point machine numbers (e.g., `Point 104A`).
* **The Implementation:** The Unified Ingestion Adapter maps continuous physical linear chainages into discrete, logical **Track Circuit IDs** (e.g., `TC-01` through `TC-06`). This ensures all directorates and algorithms operate on the exact same physical segment of track.

### 2. ML Urgency Triage & Priority Scoring
Every defect and maintenance request is evaluated by a composite mathematical priority scoring algorithm:
$$\text{Urgency Score} = 0.40 \cdot \text{Defect Severity} + 0.35 \cdot \text{Days Overdue} + 0.25 \cdot \text{Corridor Traffic Density}$$

Demands are classified into three actionable tiers:
* **P1 Critical (Score 80–100):** Immediate safety risks such as rail fractures (IMR flaws per *IRPWM 2020*), acute catenary wire sag ($< 8.25\text{ mm}$ residual thickness), or track circuit drops. Automatically slotted into the next 24-hour tactical night lull or protected with emergency caution orders.
* **P2 Periodic (Score 50–79):** Machine-bound periodic maintenance such as track tamping cycles (TGI score $< 36$) and point motor overhauls. Bundled into 7-day rolling corridor maintenance windows.
* **P3 Routine (Score 0–49):** Preventive tasks such as drain clearing, cess repairs, and insulator washing. Slotted into 30-day cyclical maintenance overhauls.

### 3. Joint Shadow-Block Optimizer Engine (Google OR-Tools CP-SAT)
The mathematical core is formulated as a Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP) utilizing constraint programming interval variables:
* **Objective Function:** Minimize total corridor downtime, train delay penalties, and deferred maintenance risks while maximizing shadow block synergy:
  $$\min Z = \alpha \sum_{i \in B} \text{DowntimeCost}(i) + \beta \sum_{j \in \text{Trains}} \text{DelayCost}(j) + \delta \sum_{k \in \text{Defects}} \text{Risk}(k) - \gamma \sum_{m \in \text{Shadow}} \text{Synergy}(m)$$
* **Hard Safety Constraints:**
  1. *Earthing Buffer:* A mandatory $\ge 10\text{ minute}$ electrical discharge earthing window ($\Delta_{\text{earth}}$) before track work begins, and a $10\text{ minute}$ restoration buffer ($\Delta_{\text{restore}}$) before re-energization.
  2. *Passenger Clearance Headway:* A mandatory $\ge 15\text{ minute}$ safety clearance window ($\Delta_{\text{clear}}$) between block termination and high-priority passenger train arrival.
  3. *Machine Contiguity:* Heavy track tampers (CSM) and Tower Wagons cannot teleport; transit times between stations are enforced mathematically.

### 4. Safety Dispatch, Kavach TCAS & Regulatory Lockouts
When the Section Controller clicks `[SANCTION BLOCK]`:
* **Kavach TCAS ATP Wireless Injection:** The Temporary Speed Restriction Management System (TSRMS) transmits digital speed caps ($30\text{ km/h}$) directly to approaching locomotive cab units over UHF/LTE radio per *RDSO/SPN/196/2020*.
* **Interlocking Lockout (Form S&T/T-351):** The Station Master's electronic interlocking panel is digitally clamped to hold entrance signals at Red.
* **Caution Orders (Form T/409):** Digital caution notices are issued automatically to loco pilots and train managers.
* **Auditor Compliance Dossier:** An immutable 4-step decision record is sealed with a SHA-256 cryptographic hash, complying with *RDSO Chapter 15* safety regulations.

## V. Trials, Experimental Scenarios & Results

| Weather Condition | Friction Coefficient ($\mu$) | Stopping Distance @ 130 km/h | Stopping Distance @ 100 km/h | Safety Behavior |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Dry Standard Track** | $\mu = 0.134$ | **703 meters** | **442 meters** | Standard RDSO braking curve. |
| **Monsoon Rain / Wet Rail** | $\mu = 0.095$ | **965 meters (+37%)** | **607 meters** | Expands safety horizon; earlier braking. |
