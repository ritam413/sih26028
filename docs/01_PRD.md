## 1. Executive Summary & Architectural Grounding

### 1.1 The Operational Challenge on Indian Railways
Indian Railways operates over 13,000 passenger trains and 8,000 freight rakes daily across 68,000+ route kilometers. To maintain track geometry, overhead equipment (OHE), and signaling infrastructure, railway engineering departments require scheduled track possessions known as **maintenance blocks**.

Currently, fixed infrastructure is maintained across separate engineering directorates (Civil/TMS, Electrical/TDMS, Signal/SMMS, Traffic/COA). Without centralized cross-departmental coordination, lines are repeatedly blocked independently, creating excessive cumulative disruption, deferred maintenance backlogs, and emergency speed restrictions.

### 1.2 Grounding Status: Core Paradigm vs Provisional Domain Reference
To maintain maximum engineering rigor and production adaptability, this system makes an explicit architectural distinction between **Grounded Core Principles** and **Provisional Domain Parameters**:

1. **Grounded Core Architecture (Validated Foundation):**
   * **Multi-Horizon Rolling Planning Framework (RHF):** 24-Hour Tactical, 7-Day Operational, and 30-Day Strategic rolling horizons.
   * **Mathematical Constraint Satisfaction:** Time-Space Disjunctive Interval Scheduling via Google OR-Tools CP-SAT.
   * **Joint Co-Location Bundling:** Mathematically overlapping concurrent multi-department maintenance tasks within unified block windows.
   * **Explainable Cryptographic Audit Trails:** Immutable multi-step decision dossiers.

2. **Provisional / Configurable Domain Parameters (Decoupled & Swappable):**
   * Specific numerical parameters (e.g., 15-min train clearance headway, 10-min OHE earthing buffers, 30 km/h default TSR speed, urgency score weight coefficients) and sensor threshold defaults (e.g., point stroke time $>4.5\text{s}$, contact wire wear $<74\text{ mm}^2$) are **provisional reference baselines** drawn from public Indian Railways manuals.
   * **Decoupling Mandate:** These domain parameters and raw data schemas are **NEVER hardcoded** into application logic. They are managed through pluggable data adapters and an externalized policy engine, ensuring seamless adjustment as real divisional data and CRIS APIs become available.

### 1.3 Decoupled & Pluggable Architecture (Ports & Adapters)
The platform follows a strict **Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters)**:
* **Pluggable Data Adapters:** Abstract ingestion interfaces (`TMSAdapter`, `TDMSAdapter`, `SMMSAdapter`, `COAAdapter`, `KavachAdapter`) allow zero-code swapping between synthetic simulation datasets, CSV/JSON file feeds, and live CRIS enterprise APIs.
* **Externalized Policy & Constraint Engine:** All safety buffers, urgency weights, operational penalty coefficients, and dispatch rules reside in configurable policy profiles (`DivisionalPolicyProfile`), dynamically injected into the solver at runtime.
* **Extensible Data Contracts:** All core data models carry generic `metadata: JSONB` and `rawPayload: JSONB` fields with schema versioning to accommodate evolving external data formats without database migrations.

## 2. Product Vision & Value Proposition: Auto-BDMS

**IRIS AI (Intelligent Railway Inspection and Restoration AI)** unifies maintenance requisitions across all engineering directorates and synchronizes them with real-time train paths from COA:

1. **Pluggable Multi-Source Ingestion:** Ingests defect logs from TMS, TDMS, and SMMS, automatically mapping physical linear chainages into discrete electrical Track Circuit IDs via configurable spatial lookup tables.
2. **Direct Online Requisition Portal:** Provides an interactive web form for TDMS (Electrical TRD), SMMS (S&T), and TMS (Civil) officers to submit live block demands with instant AI feasibility previews, shadow bundling synergy feedback, and regulatory notice issuance.
3. **Automated Joint Shadow Blocking:** Clusters co-located demands into coordinated Joint Shadow Blocks underneath de-energized OHE windows during natural nocturnal traffic lulls.
4. **CP-SAT Disjunctive Optimization:** Solves corridor time-distance scheduling with zero passenger train cancellations, configurable safety headways, and parameter-driven earthing buffers.
5. **Multi-Horizon Rolling Framework (RHF):** Grounded planning across **24-Hour Tactical**, **7-Day Operational**, and **30-Day Strategic** rolling horizons.
6. **Decoupled Safety Dispatch & Compliance:** Emits speed restrictions via Kavach adapters, interlocking lockouts, caution orders, and immutable SHA-256 audit dossiers.

## 3. Key Operational Invariants & Grounded Constraints

1. **Zero Passenger Train Cancellation (Grounded Invariant):** The solver strictly enforces that no scheduled passenger train path is cancelled or truncated.
2. **Configurable Passenger Safety Clearance Headway ($\Delta_{\text{clear}}$):** Enforces a parameter-driven buffer (default reference: $\ge 15\text{ min}$) between block termination and high-priority train arrivals.
3. **Configurable OHE Power Block Earthing Buffers ($\Delta_{\text{earth}}, \Delta_{\text{restore}}$):** Work beneath 25kV OHE begins after power isolation & earthing (default reference: $\ge 10\text{ min}$), concluding prior to re-energization (default reference: $\ge 10\text{ min}$).
4. **Gradient-Aware Machine Kinematics:** Machine transit velocities between sidings and worksites factor in locomotive tractive effort, track gradients ($G_s$), and curve resistance ($r_c$).
5. **Fail-Safe Interlocking State:** Conflicting signals are clamped to danger (`RED`) upon block sanction to protect track crews.
